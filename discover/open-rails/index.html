			Our Open Rails project provides a free train simulator for the largest collection of digital content in the world - routes, 
			rolling stock, activities and timetables. 
			Our <a href="/discover/statistics/">statistics</a> reveal that we have around 25,000 active users.
		</p><p>
			Open Rails is open, as the name suggests and the <a href="/discover/license/">license</a> guarantees. 
			It is a project developed, maintained and nurtured by a team of volunteers. 
			Our team is working to provide a sound future for the communities' content (both <a href="/share/community/">free</a> and <a href="/trade/">commercial</a>) and to create the best 
			possible train simulator.
		</p><p>
			Suggestions for improvements are welcome – see our <a href="/discover/roadmap/">Roadmap</a> and also see <a href="https://trello.com/b/DS2h3Pxc/open-rails-roadmap">ideas you can vote on</a> and submit yourself.

		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<p>
			Microsoft Train Simulator (MSTS), which was launched in 2001, was very successful but Microsoft had several false starts at 
			developing it further, which stimulated the launch of the Open Rails project in 2009.
		</p><p>			
			Open Rails is independent of Microsoft and now runs the trains on routes built to MSTS standards but with all the 
			advantages in performance and graphics that the passing years make possible.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>
			The project reached its initial goal – running MSTS trains at least as well as MSTS did – some time ago.
		</p><p>
			Along the way many valuable features have been added, visual improvements such as superelevation and 3D  cabs and operational ones 
			such as timetables, container cranes and ETCS. 
			We also provide multi-player and control from connected devices such as RailDriver or a web browser.
		</p><p>
			The standards for MSTS content have restricted Open Rails in many ways, e.g. curved track must be circular arcs so transition 
			curves are not possible. 
			In response, a current aim is to leave behind these restrictions while still supporting content built to these old standards.
		</p><p>
			Another aim is to make it easier to build routes, with options to generate lineside objects instead of placing them individually.
		</p><p>
			Our goal is to enhance the railroad simulation hobby through an open platform, designed and supported by the community to 
			provide a lasting foundation for accurate and immersive simulation experiences.
		</p>

		<h2>Open Rails is "open"</h2>
		<p>
			Open Rails lives up to its name - a railroad simulation platform that's open for inspection, open for continuous improvement, 
			open to third parties and commercial enterprises, open to the community and, best of all, an open door to the future.
