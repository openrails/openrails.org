<h1>Routes</h1>              
<p>Next to the "Demo Model 1" route presented in the <a href=/discover/get-started/index.html>Getting Started</a> we recommend two other routes 
which you can find in the <a href=/download/explore-content/index.html>Content Browser</a>.</p>
<h2>BNSF Starter Route</h2>
<br/>
<p>{%- include slideshow.html height="62" unit="%" duration="nil" route="scenic" -%}</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  This is a free starter route, created by <a href=https://www.trainsimulations.net>TrainSimulations</a>. 
  It comes with trainsets and activities based on the BNSF Scenic Subdivision in the Pacific Northwest Region of the United States.
</p>
<p>
  This route can be installed in OR via the menu Content --> "Auto Installed" form. It starts with the activity "What goes up...". 
  In this activity you are driving a freight train with 4 BNSF C44-9W diesel locomotives and more then 60 wagons!
</p>

<br/>
<h3>Great Zig Zag Railway - New South Wales</h3>
<br/>
<p>{%- include slideshow.html height="62" unit="%" duration="nil" route="zigzag" -%}</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  This route, now a heritage line, comes with 7 tutorial activities which introduce you progressively to the challenges of
  managing a steam-hauled train.
</p>
<p>
  Has to be installed manually. See "Install Zig Railway Route Content" on webpage 
  <a href=https://www.zigzag.coalstonewcastle.com.au/route/route-install/>Great Zig Zag Railway</a>.
</p>

<h1>Stand-alone Content</h1>
<p>
  Some content relies on the presence of files from MSTS, such as sound files and cab interiors.
  This is usually the case for free content downloaded from forums, so installing this content can be tricky.
</p>
<p>
  Content which has no such dependence (typically labelled as "stand-alone" or "mini-route") is easy to install.
  All the content in the <a href=/download/explore-content/index.html>Content Browser</a> is currently stand-alone.
</p>

<h1>Specific to Open Rails</h1>
<p>
  Although Open Rails will run any routes made for MSTS, many features and refinements are only available in content made 
  specially for Open Rails. Here are some examples.
</p><p>
  The Spanish websites <a href="http://viajerosaltren.es">Viajeros al Tren</a> and <a href="http://www.spaintrainzrutas.com/">Spain Trainz Rutas</a> are some of the first to offer Open Rails-specific products.
  </p><p>
  <a href="https://dekogames.com/wordpress/csx-mainline-power/">Deko Games</a> offer SD60M and SD40-2 locos with 3D cabs exclusively for Open Rails.
  </p><p>
  Some Australian routes (New South Wales) have been packaged by Peter Newell to work just with Open Rails:
