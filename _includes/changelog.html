<li><code>36d87c32</code> - functtion matchesConsistNoOrder now returns train when train contains the wagons of the activity drop off wagonlist<br>- Some actvity lists may only contain the first and last wagon. Check that first and last wagon match with those two wagons in the activity list.<br>- check if drop off train is a STATIC one</li>
<li><code>ba9e40a2</code> If the Work Orders list in the Help from (F1) is larger than the form and scroll bar was used to scroll down, status changes make the Work Orders tab go to the top again. Disturbing... This fix makes the form stay at the current scroll position. Also the case when switching tabs.</li>
<li><code>84f72b8d</code> Some lists may only contain the first and last wagon. Undone the previous change in matchesConsistNoOrder.</li>
<li><code>1ad59d77</code> Fix on previous fix. Now siding check is done on wagons dropped. And amount of wagos dropped has to be exactly the amount on the activity asked list.</li>
