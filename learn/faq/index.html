        <h3>What is Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
        Open Rails is a train simulator project compatible with Microsoft's Train Simulator product.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Open Rails freeware? Is there a downloadable version available?</h3>
        <p>
        Yes. A variety of downloads <a href="../../download/program/">are available here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Open Rails just an improved version of Microsoft Train Simulator?</h3>
        <p>
        Open Rails is not an improvement to Microsoft Train Simulator, but a complete new simulator that can use Microsoft Train Simulator routes, activities, consists and train sets. At
installation, Open Rails looks for Microsoft Train Simulator entries in the Windows registry to locate any Microsoft Train Simulator files on your computer. It will offer to use them
in the simulation.
        </p><p>
        The Open Rails simulator operates train services independently of Microsoft Train Simulator and without running any Microsoft Train Simulator code. 
        Currently, to build your own routes, you must use <a href="http://koniec.org/tsre5/">Goku's modern editor TSRE5</a> or 
        even the original Microsoft Train Simulator Route Editor, but we plan to develop our own Route Editor.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use my collection of Microsoft Train Simulator locomotives and rolling stock with Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
        The short answer is 'yes'.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use my collection of Microsoft Train Simulator routes with Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
        The short answer is 'yes'.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use my collection of Microsoft Train Simulator activities with Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
        The answer is "Yes", though the signaling in Open Rails and performance of AI (computer-driven) trains is more rigorous and some activities may need adjusting.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there any routes available for Open Rails that do not need Microsoft Train Simulator?</h3>
        <p>
            Some older content relies on the presence of files from MSTS, such as sound files and cab interiors.
            This is usually the case for free content downloaded from forums, so installing this content can be tricky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Content which has no such dependence (typically labelled as "stand-alone" or "mini-route") is easy to install.
            All the content in the <a href=/download/content/index.html>Content Browser</a> is currently stand-alone.
        </p>
        <h3>Where can I find content that takes advantage of features only available in Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
            Although Open Rails will run any routes made for MSTS, many features and refinements are only available in content made 
            specially for Open Rails. Here are some examples.
        </p><p>
            The Spanish websites <a href="http://viajerosaltren.es">Viajeros al Tren</a> and <a href="http://www.spaintrainzrutas.com/">Spain Trainz Rutas</a> are some of the first to offer Open Rails-specific products.
            </p><p>
            <a href="https://dekogames.com/wordpress/csx-mainline-power/">Deko Games</a> offer SD60M and SD40-2 locos with 3D cabs exclusively for Open Rails.
            </p><p>
            Some Australian routes (New South Wales) have been packaged by Peter Newell to work just with Open Rails:

        <h2><span id="technical_questions">Technical Questions</span></h2>
        <h3>What computer specs do I need to run Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
    The latest system and software requirements are <a href="#hardware_requirements">shown below</a>.
</p>

        <h3>Does Open Rails have 3D cabs?</h3>
        <p>
    Yes, these have been supported for a while alongside the older 2D cabs.
</p>

        <h3>Does Open Rails have working signals?</h3>
        <p>
    The Open Rails team has implemented a comprehensive and robust signal system which is detailed in the manual.
</p>

        <h3>Does Open Rails have timetables?</h3>
        <p>
    Yes, timetables provide multiple trains running at the same time, with complex operations such as splitting and joining trains as described in the manual.
    You can choose which train to drive and the other trains in the timetable will run automatically.
</p>

        <h3>Does Open Rails have multi-player operation?</h3>
        <p>
    Yes, you can share your session with as many remote friends as your computer can cope with, all working together driving individual trains to 
    deliver a service.
</p>

        <h3>What's the graphics engine in Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
    Open Rails currently uses Monogame technology to display its environment. This makes good use of modern graphics cards and is also
    compatible with the <a href="https://reshade.me">ReShade graphics post-processor</a>. Installation advice can be <a href="http://www.elvastower.com/forums/index.php?/topic/33511-open-rails-mg-and-reshade/">found here at Elvas Tower</a>.
</p>

        <h3>What about a route editor for Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
    An Open Rails route editor is a key element of the project and <a href="/discover/roadmap/">is identified in our
    project roadmap</a>.
</p>

        <h3>What should I do if I find problems, issues or stuff not working with Open Rails?</h3>
        <p>
    Open Rails is a constantly evolving project that runs on volunteer participation. Please feel free to post questions and comments
    about <a href="/share/community/">Open Rails on the forums</a>. The Open Rails team monitors these forums daily.
