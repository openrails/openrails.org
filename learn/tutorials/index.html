        <h2>Test Environment for Models</h2>
        <p>
        One of our aims for Open Rails is that train performance should be as realistic as possible. 
        To help achieve this,
        Peter Newell has developed <a href="http://www.coalstonewcastle.com.au/physics/">an environment for testing</a> 
        the performance of locos and rolling stock. Do they perform as we expect?
        </p><p>
        It may be the model that is not configured correctly or, as Open Rails develops, it may be that the simulator is lacking 
        in realism.
        </p><p>
        In either case, a neutral, repeatable test environment helps to pin down the issue and get it fixed.
